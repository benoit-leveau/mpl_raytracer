Overview
========

Raytracer written entirely using MPL, boost's meta-programming library.

Written in a few days in September 2009 to learn about boost::mpl.

Maybe the only interesting thing about it is the implementation of sqrt for floats using only templates.

Compilers Tested
================

Originally tested with MSVC8 (VS2005) and whatever boost distribution I was using at the time.

Recently tested with gcc 4.2.1 and Boost 1.53.
